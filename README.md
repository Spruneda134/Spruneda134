# 👋 Hey, I'm Salvador 

Software Engineer focused on building fast, reliable web applications with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind**, **Flask**, and **Supabase**.

I care about:
- Shipping production-ready features
- Clean, maintainable code
- Performance, SEO, and accessibility
- UX that actually feels good to use

---

## 💻 Tech

- **Frontend:** Next.js, React, TypeScript, JavaScript (ES6+), Tailwind CSS, HTML5, CSS3  
- **Backend:** Flask, Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Realtime), RESTful APIs  
- **Workflow:** Git/GitHub, Figma, Lighthouse, Core Web Vitals, SEMrush  
- **CS & Data:** C++, SQL (relational design & queries)

---

## 💬 What This GitHub Shows

- Full-stack projects (frontend + backend + database)
- Experiments with auth, real-time features, and performance
- Practice repos as I refine architecture and patterns

If a repo is pinned, it’s something I’m comfortable showing as an example of how I work.
